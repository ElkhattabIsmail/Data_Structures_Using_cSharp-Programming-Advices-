Definition: HashSet<T> is a collection class in the System.Collections.Generic namespace designed to store unique elements.

Uniqueness: The primary feature of HashSet<T> is that it automatically ensures all elements are unique.

No Indexing: Unlike lists, HashSet<T> does not maintain the order of its elements and does not support indexing.
Generic: HashSet<T> is a generic collection, meaning it can store any type of object.

-> Linq Works with the Generic Collections.
